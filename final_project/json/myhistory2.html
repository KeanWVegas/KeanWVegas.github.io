<p> After a while of riding little cheap ramps that we made with very limited capability, my friends and I decided to start going to the local skatepark. We would ride our bikes about 4 miles each way in order to get to it, but it was worth every sweaty second. We began by talking to the older riders around us, who gradually got to know us and were willing to teach us. We began learning more and more tricks, and over time became pretty well-learned at the sport. It became our lifestyle.</p>
