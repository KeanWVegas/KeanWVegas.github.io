<p>After riding for about 10 years on and off, I've really grown to love the sport. I began by riding around the neighborhood with my friends, riding off of curbs with a cheap little Mongoose bike. That thing would fall apart every other week it felt like. I remember learning how to fix it, and I remember taking some pretty nasty spills on it. One time when I was in fourth grade, to impress a girl, I rode as fast as I could and jumped off of a little 2 foot tall wooden jump I made. I woke up about 3 hours later with road rash all over my face, and apparently I still tried to hit the jump again in my semi-concious state.</p>
