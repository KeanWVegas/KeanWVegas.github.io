<p>Now that you have a BMX bike you can take it to one of your nearby skateparks found using our 'Nearby Parks ' tool. I would recommend watching and getting to know some of the people at the park, and ask if they could teach you the basics. If that isn't really possible for you, I 'd recommend by watching some beginner videos on youtube- I'll link a few below.</p>
