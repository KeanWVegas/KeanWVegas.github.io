<p> From the ages of 10-14 we dedicated ourselves to the sport, and eventually we entered competitions. I entered the Las Vegas Am Jam at 13 years old, and won the intermediate division, while placing #12 out of 30 in the advanced division. It was at this point that I kind of fell away from BMX due to troubles at home, and didn't start up again until I was 17. I've ridden on and off since then, and recently just rebuilt and repainted my bike. I'm now riding at Rexburg Nature Park every week or so and loving it.</p>
