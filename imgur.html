            <img alt='Imgur Screenshot' src='imgur%20screenshot.png' width='300'>
            <a href="http://imgur.com/">Imgur</a>

            <h2> Contrast</h2>
            <p> 1. They knew exactly who their target audience was, and caters to them via personalized ads and jokes from the creators about recent subjects on the home page.</p>
            <p> 2. They met every need for the audience as an image-hosting website.</p>
            <p> 3. The organization was rather impeccable, and it allowed for a laid-back feeling of easy use.</p>
            <p> 4. The site completely facilitated visitors on mobile devices. Every function worked perfectly to the touch, and felt nearly app-like, even without having to download an app.</p>
            <p> When first visiting Imgur.com on a mobile, you come to a black background with contrasting gray colors to label the toolbars against the hosted pictures.</p>
            <p> The website is highly optimized for mobile use, and allows for quick movement through the different pictures and pages.</p>
            <p>By pressing on the 3 bars on the top left it has a drop down menu that allows you to go to the home, search the site, sign in, register an account, give feedback, apply for a job, and access their Imgur store. It is also where they list their footer containing their ToS, desktop view and to open the app. </p>

            <img alt='KBB' src='kbb.png' width='300pt'>
            <p> There were too many things wrong with this website to list.</p>
            <p> First, I guess, is that there were at least 12 different broken links.</p>
            <p> The next would definitely be that when you press that back button, it brings you back to the homepage, even if you're just trying to move back one.</p>
            <p> Huge, un-closable ads get in the way of your objective, and make it rather irritating to deal with.</p>
            <p> Trying to navigate away from the menu without clicking on something in the menu is also not possible.</p>
