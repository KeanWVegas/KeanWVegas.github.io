            <h2> Persona </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Name: Jacob Smith</li>
                <li> Age: 18 </li>
                <li> Gender: Male</li>
                <li> Family Status: Single, living at home</li>
                <li> Hobbies: Extreme Sports</li>
                <li> Goal: Learn about BMX and how to get started</li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Scenario </h3>
            <p> Jacob is heavily into snowboarding and skiing, but it's currently Summer, so there's no snow to ride on. He is looking into other hobbies, from Lacrosse to Skateboarding, and has settled on learning how to ride BMX. He can use my "How to get started" page to learn where he can purchase a bike, as well as use my "Nearby Parks" page to find where to begin. He can return to the first page to be able to find resources on beginning tricks and how to actually ride the bike.</p>

            <h2> Style</h2>
            <p> I plan on having a very symplistic design that is very easy to navigate. It will allow the user to obtain as much information as possible without having to work to get it.</p>
            <p> I will keep a clean, easy UI with the simple colors light gray and ivory. the Header/NavBar/content areas will make use of the ivory, while the gray is used behind the containers. </p>
            <p> The font I plan on using for my Headers is called <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dosis">'Dosis'</a> on google fonts. The font I plan on using for my Content is called
                <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yanone+Kaffeesatz">'Yanone Kaffeesatz'</a> on google fonts. </p>
