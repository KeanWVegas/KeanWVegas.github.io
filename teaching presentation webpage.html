                <h2> Pseudo Class</h2>
                <p> A pseduo class is a command used to modify a special state of an element. With them, you're able to do things like mouse-over shadows, drop down boxes, and much more.</p>
                <h2> Pseudo Class Extended</h2>
                <p> As we recently learned, CSS has a syntax, much like every language does. This means that even with the pseudo coding you must have a syntax. The syntax for pseudo-classes is: selector:pseudo-class {    property:value; } This basically means that with the help of the selector, we can tell the html to select the wanted pseudo-class, and then change the properties to any of the many types of pseudo classes.
                </p>
                <h2> Pseudo Elements</h2>
                <p>Pseudo-Elements are also used to style specific parts of an element. They are mostly used to tell when or where to use a pseudo class though. Here’s an example: input[type=text] {    width: 100px;    transition: ease-in-out, width .35s ease-in-out;}input[type=text]:focus {    width: 250px;} This basically says that when you hover over something, it’s going to zoom in to your specified pixel width and height over ‘x’ time.
