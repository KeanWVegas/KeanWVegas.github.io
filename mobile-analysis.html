            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
            <p> For this project I was asked to spend a full 24 hours working with websites using nothing but my mobile phone. I was able to switch from using my computer to using my phone (with the exception of I-Learn for homework) completely. I visited image hosting websites such as Imgur, search engines such as Google, social media such as Reddit, and utility websites such as Kelly Blue Book. Each one had it's own up's and down's on mobile, such as broken links, awkward placement, slow loading times, and intrusive ads.</p>
            
            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>On most of the websites I had no problem with being able to see the content of the page, with the exception of Kelly Blue Book, where the pictures were too small for a mobile display.</p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>I was able to find exactly what I was looking for on each page! Imgur and Reddit both had a great navigation that allowed me to find certain categories of content rather easily due to their tagging system. Google, of course, has a nearly perfected search engine that allowed me to flawlessly find any content that I needed. Kelly Blue Book had a very distinct system that allowed for me to search for a vehicle by Make, Model, Year, Style, Color, and much more, which allowed for a very fluid search experience.</p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>The fluidity of each site was pretty on par, which allowed me to very easily accomplish my goal for each site. For Imgur it was finding funny or another category of pictures. Reddit allowed me to find 'Sub-Reddits' (sub-categories designated to a certain content) that matched what I was interested in checking out. Google helped me to find certain articles that helped with this assignment with no frustrations. Lastly, Kelly Blue Book allowed me to find a certain car or type of car with straight-forward simplicity.</p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>Every website had ads, but the most intrusive and frustrating was Kelly Blue Book. The ads would pop up and on mobile it wouldn't let me close them. When I tried checking the website out with developer tools on Chrome, when I switched to iPhone it allowed me to. Very interesting that it wouldn't allow my personal android to though.</p>
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>Nothing necessarily worked better on the small screen, but they all worked fluidly with the space they were given. Not meaning to pick on KBB here, but their's was much worse than their computer counterpart.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I use most of these website regularly, so there were no surprises, but I did enjoy being able to go through and critique them. Imgur, Reddit and Google all worked as well as their non-mobile sites, which allowed for a great experience. Kelly Blue Book had multiple problems with intrusive ads and a few more things. Overall most of the sites worked plenty fine on mobile. </p>
